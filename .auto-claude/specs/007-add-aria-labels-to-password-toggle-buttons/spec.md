# Add ARIA labels to password toggle buttons

## Overview

The password visibility toggle buttons in login and register forms lack aria-label attributes, making them inaccessible to screen reader users

## Rationale

Screen reader users cannot understand what the eye/eye-off button does without an aria-label. This is a basic accessibility requirement.
