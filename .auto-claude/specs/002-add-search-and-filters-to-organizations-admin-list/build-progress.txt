# Build Progress: Add Search and Filters to Organizations Admin List

## Status: Planning Complete

## Implementation Plan Created
- 2 phases with 6 subtasks total
- Phase 1: Add Filters to Organizations Page (4 subtasks)
- Phase 2: Testing and Verification (2 subtasks)

## Key Findings from Codebase Analysis

### Backend (Already Implemented)
- `backend/api/views_admin_orgs.py` already supports:
  - `search` - text search by org name (case-insensitive contains)
  - `status` - filter by "active" or "inactive"
  - `license_tier` - filter by tier (free, starter, pro, enterprise)

### Frontend Hook (Already Implemented)
- `useOrganizations` hook accepts `OrgsQueryParams` with all filter params
- Located at: `frontend/src/lib/api/organizations/queries.ts`

### Reference Pattern (Users Page)
- `frontend/src/routes/admin/_layout/users/index.tsx` shows the exact pattern to follow
- Uses Select dropdowns with w-[180px] width
- Filter row uses `flex items-center gap-4`

### Target File
- `frontend/src/routes/admin/_layout/organizations/index.tsx`
- Currently has no filtering - just calls `useOrganizations()` with no params

## Progress Summary

### Completed Subtasks
- ✅ 1.1: Add filter state and imports - Added useState hooks for all filters and imported required components
- ✅ 1.2: Implement search debouncing - Added useEffect with 300ms debounce for search input
- ✅ 1.3: Pass filter params to useOrganizations hook - Updated hook call to pass search, status, and license_tier parameters

### Next Steps
1. Implement subtask 1.4: Add filter UI components to the page layout
