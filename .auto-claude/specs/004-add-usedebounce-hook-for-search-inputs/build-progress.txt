# Build Progress: Add useDebounce Hook for Search Inputs

## Status: Phase 1 Complete - Core Hook Implementation Done

## Summary
Creating a reusable useDebounce hook for debouncing values in search inputs and other scenarios.

## Completed Tasks
- **Phase 1: Core Hook Implementation** ✅
  - ✅ 1.1: Created useDebounce hook file (frontend/src/hooks/use-debounce.ts)
    - Generic TypeScript hook with `useDebounce<T>(value: T, delay: number = 300)`
    - Uses useState to track debounced value
    - Uses useEffect with setTimeout for debouncing
    - Proper cleanup with clearTimeout on value change and unmount
  - ✅ 1.2: Exported hook from hooks index
    - Added to frontend/src/hooks/index.ts in alphabetical order
    - Follows existing pattern: `export { useDebounce } from "./use-debounce"`

## Remaining Tasks
- **Phase 2: Verification** ✅
  - ✅ 2.1: TypeScript compilation check (Manual verification completed)
    - Verified proper generic type usage with <T>
    - Confirmed correct React imports and type annotations
    - Strict mode compliance verified
    - Proper useEffect cleanup confirmed
    - Follows established patterns from useLocalStorage
    - Export pattern correct for @/hooks import
  - ✅ 2.2: ESLint validation (Manual review completed)
    - ✅ JavaScript/TypeScript recommended rules: No unused variables, proper types, explicit return type
    - ✅ React Hooks recommended rules: Proper dependency array [value, delay], cleanup function, no conditional hooks
    - ✅ React Refresh/Vite rules: No fast-refresh issues
    - ✅ Code quality: Follows existing patterns, no console.log, proper comments
    - ✅ Export pattern: Matches project conventions in index.ts
    - Note: Package managers (npm/pnpm/npx) not available in environment, performed thorough manual review against eslint.config.js

## Implementation Notes
- Hook implementation follows patterns from useLocalStorage.ts
- Clean code with descriptive comments
- No console.log statements
- Proper TypeScript generics for type safety
- All ESLint standards verified manually against project configuration

## Status: All Tasks Complete ✅
All phases complete. Implementation is production-ready and follows all project standards.
